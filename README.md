# Particle Life: An Artificial Life System

## Overview
Particle Life is a final year bachelor project that explores the dynamics of artificial life through a force-based system with incorporated evolutionary mechanisms. Developed using Processing, this project delves into simulating emergent behaviors akin to life forms within a digital environment.

## Features
- **Force-Based Simulation**: The project utilizes a force-based approach to model interactions among particles, allowing for dynamic movements and behaviors.
- **Evolutionary Mechanisms**: Incorporates evolutionary principles to drive the adaptation and emergence of diverse behaviors within the simulated population.
- **Interactive Environment**: Users can observe and interact with the simulated particles, influencing their behaviors and observing the effects of various parameters.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides visual representations of simulated behaviors and evolutionary progress, aiding in analysis and understanding.

## Installation
To run Particle Life on your system, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Processing installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from [Processing.org](https://processing.org/download/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the main sketch file (`ParticleLife.pde`) in Processing.
4. Click the "Play" button in the Processing IDE to execute the simulation.

## Usage
Once Particle Life is running, you can interact with the simulation in the following ways:
- **Keyboard Controls**: Utilize keyboard inputs to adjust simulation parameters or toggle specific functionalities.
- **Observation**: Observe the emergent behaviors of particles and how they evolve over time.
